```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
income <- read_csv("../data/income.csv")
```

## Introduction

The income.csv contains data for gender-based weekly income amount in various industry and occupation.
By looking at the csv file, I come up with following question: what is industry that owns the greatest average weekly income for female workers?

Data Summary:
```{r income}
summary(income)
```

## Analysis

First, I need to group this dataset by industries, since we do not care about specific occupation.
Then apply a linear regression.
Finally plot the results.
```{r}

```

## Conclusion

As a result, Management Industry owns the greatest average weekly income for female workers.
